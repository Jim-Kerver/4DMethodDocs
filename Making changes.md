After creating your first website, there are probably a lot of changes you want to make. To simplify these changes, make sure that you have all your [Configurations](docs/Configs.md) done for the programs that we are going to use.

We will use obsidian only for altering the content of the documentation and blog section. We will use VSCode to alter the website's look and behaviour.

Alterations to the website's look and behavour are mostly a 'one time thing'. When the website looks the way you want to, only the content needs to be updated. That's why we will first focus on the look, and later on the content.
